<blockquote>
As anyone looking for decent support or even useful information over the past few months can attest, the revival of TextDrive has not been a success.
<br /><br />
What began in mid-2012 as an exciting challenge fuelled by good intentions and lean resources quickly turned into a cleanup project with almost no resources.
<br /><br />
It is disappointing to report that after a year and a half of uphill battles and unimagined setbacks, after several costly efforts to regroup and find another way, options to keep TextDrive growing have run out, and we will cease operations on the 14th of March, 2014.
<br /><br />
For those who wish to know, details of what went wrong will be made available once shutdown operations have completed.
<br /><br />
Sorry to have let you down.

And with that, the old blog died.  Over the next few months, I am going to migrate some content and add some new content.  

It seems fitting in this age of the age of the reboot.  The old blog is dead!  Long live the new blog!
